Definition:
"The Singleton design pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and
 provides a global point of access to that instance. It's commonly used when we want to have a single instance
 of a class throughout the application lifecycle, such as managing shared resources, configuration settings,
  or maintaining global state.

Purpose and Use Cases:

The Singleton pattern is used to ensure that a class has only one instance, which is globally accessible.
It's suitable for scenarios where we need centralized access to a shared resource or state, such as logging, database connections, caches, or configuration settings.

Implementation Approaches:

Singleton can be implemented using various approaches, including eager initialization, lazy initialization, thread-safe initialization, double-checked locking, Bill Pugh Singleton, or Enum Singleton.
Each approach has its advantages and disadvantages in terms of thread safety, resource consumption, and initialization overhead.

Eager vs. Lazy Initialization:

Eager initialization creates the Singleton instance eagerly at the time of class loading, ensuring thread safety but potentially impacting startup time.
Lazy initialization creates the Singleton instance on-demand when it is first accessed, conserving resources but requiring synchronization to ensure thread safety.

Thread Safety:

Ensuring thread safety is crucial in Singleton implementation, especially in multi-threaded environments.
Techniques such as synchronized methods/block, volatile variables, or atomic classes can be used to achieve thread safety.
